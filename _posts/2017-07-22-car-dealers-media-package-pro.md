# **Car Dealers Media Package Pro**

An article from the [New York from April 9th, 2015][0], revealed that

> "While large companies have learned how to stand out on social networks and get lots of hand-holding from sites like Facebook and Twitter, most local business owners are left on their own and remain stumped by social marketing"

On the other hand, another [global study, this time from the consulting  
firm Capgemini][1], and echoed by the New York Times, states that from   
the survey of 10,000 buyers revealed that

> "More than 10,000 active car buyers found that social media ranked far below dealer websites, web searching and the automotive news media as a source of information for buyers. But most respondents also said they used social media to research cars, planned to post something about their buying experience and expected dealers to have an active social media presence".

Some challenges restaurant/bar owners encounter is that whether they do not what  
type of content to post, how often they should, how much to spend in effective ad-  
vertising and how to build a broad-base of hunrgy-loyal customers.
