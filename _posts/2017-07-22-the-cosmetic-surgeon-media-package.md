people to make their business grow. 

Social Media can definitely impact a Cosmetic Surgeon's Business,

is more conscious of their own perception. Think of the fact how

not-so-white-coffee-stained teeth when taking a picture.

Surgeon to change their appearances and look great online, all  
the time.
