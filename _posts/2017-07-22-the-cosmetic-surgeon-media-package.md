Social Media can definitely impact a Cosmetic Surgeon's Business,   
call it a Cosmetic Dentist or Plastic Surgeon.

With the arrival and popularity of selfies in the Social Media, people  
is more conscious of their own perception. Think of the fact how   
many people use filters in Instagram just to vanish wrinkled-eyes,  
swelling neck skin and hide some belly buttons, or whitening those  
not-so-white-coffee-stained teeth when taking a picture.  
This has definitely encouraged more people to go to a Cosmetic   
Surgeon to change their appearances and look great online, all  
the time.

_**Reputation cannot be left alone**_

Social Media has given Cosmetic Surgeons, like Plastic Surgeons   
and Cosmetic Dentist Surgeons the never-before seen ability to   
embrace all the good and the bad about cosmetic surgeons. And  
as never before, more people are going to Cosmetic Surgeons to   
make a change in their bodies so shift a permanent change in   
their mind and self-esteem for the rest of their lives.

_**So if you are a Cosmetic Surgeon, ask yourself these questions:**_

Channels to grow your business,gain more reputation and become   
a reputable and prominent leader at your industry?

Do you have a website?
