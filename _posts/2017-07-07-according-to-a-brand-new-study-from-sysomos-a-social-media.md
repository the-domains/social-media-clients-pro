  According to a brand new study from Sysomos, a social media software provider,
  and Marketwired, a business news data channel, up to 60 to 70% of all
  investors surveyed say they use "traditional" sources of information (like
  newspapers and Wall Street analyst reports); but 40% say they use social media
  as a key investment information source. Given the relatively short lifespan of
  platforms like Facebook and Twitter, that's an eye-opening number, Sysomos
  says.
